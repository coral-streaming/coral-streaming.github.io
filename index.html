<p>Coral is a real-time event processing and streaming analytics platform. Coral listens to events from Kafka, transforms these events using dynamically configurable pipelines and outputs other events to Kafka or to other APIâ€™s. The Coral platform can be controlled by a RESTful API.</p>

<p>To get started using Coral, see the Getting started section. That section contains a tutorial on how to set up Coral, how to create your first pipeline and how to start processing data. </p>

  <strong>Warning</strong>:&nbsp;Currently, Coral is in its <i>alpha</i> stage. This means that it is likely that major bugs will be found, that functionality is not yet complete, and that the usefulness of the platform is limited. The documentation on this website may very well not match the current implementation of the platform. It is also possible that the API interface will change in the future. However, we do intend to keep the API as stable as possible.
